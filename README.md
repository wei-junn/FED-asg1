# Bikes SG
Bikes SG is a company that provides reliable maintainance services for a wide range of bikes. Their website aims to provide
a satisfiable user experience by showcasing their products, services and brand identity to its customers. Some of the 
services which are included are: tyre and brake servicing, bike frames and chain servicing, and handlebar replacement. 

Design Process
To help Bikes SG meet their goals and showcase their brand and wide range of products/services, I have decided to create a
website that has 4 pages:
1. The home page, where users are greeted with a call to action to explore the Bikes SG.
Some ideas include having a video/image that represents the brand on this page so that users have a good first impression.
2. The services page, where users get to learn about the variety of services that Bikes SG provides, and can easily decide 
which service they are looking for. 
-->There should also be a hyperlink that brings users to the Contact Us page so they can place an appointment/ask any 
questions about a service conveniently.
3. The about us page, which showcases the reliability and customer-centeric goals of Bikes SG, aiming to spread the brand 
culture and identity of Bikes SG. 
-->This page should have a clean layout that includes the use of pictures/videos that makes
the storytelling process easier to understand for them.
4. The gallery page, which shows pictures of Bikes SG staff carrying out various services on bikes, and showcase famous 
clients who are frequent customers of Bikes SG.
-->This page aims to give users a sense of trust and an idea of what they are looking for in a bike servocing company, by
highlighting the reliable services that offers high customer satisfaction.
5. The contact us page, where users fill out a form with their name, email, phone number and a message that indicates which
service they want to arrange, or any queries they have about any products/services.
-->By keepimng th form short and with minimun details,users should be able to complete the form in a short amount of time.
After that, by contacting them through their personal details, it provides a more personal and 1 to 1 customer experience.
